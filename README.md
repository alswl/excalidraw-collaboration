About public network release:

if you want to release your own excalidraw in public network,
you should modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file,
Replace the `REACT_APP_HTTP_STORAGE_BACKEND_URL` and `REACT_APP_WS_SERVER_URL` with your own domain.

## Q & A

### How to deploy on the cloud(aws etc)

The `docker-compose.yaml` file is for local deploy, if you want to deploy on the cloud,
you should prepare 2 Load Balancer(with HTTPS cert), one for websocket server, one for storage server.

The `REACT_APP_HTTP_STORAGE_BACKEND_URL` is for the Load Balancer URL(HTTPS) for storage,
and the `REACT_APP_WS_SERVER_URL` is for the Load Balancer URL(HTTPS) for websocket.

Here is a conversation about how to deploy on the aws: https://github.com/alswl/excalidraw-collaboration/issues/22

### generateKey problem

Error message:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'generateKey')
```

Why: The excalidraw is using crypto module of Javascript, the HTTPS is required.

How to solve: use HTTPS to access the page, or use http://localhost instead.
