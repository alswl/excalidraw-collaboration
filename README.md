# excalidraw-collaboration

Demo:

[demo](https://excalidraw-production-1dbf.up.railway.app) on [Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=HM_ZCO)
(Please using the referral code help me get Railway credits to running the demo.)

If the demo is down (sometime no free plan credits), you can one click to deploy your excalidraw with collaboration.

About public network release:

if you want to release your own excalidraw in public network,
you should modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file,
Replace the `VITE_APP_HTTP_STORAGE_BACKEND_URL` and `VITE_APP_WS_SERVER_URL` with your own domain.

## Advanced mode

### advanced-nginx

Features:

- Setup with one domain, and use nginx to proxy the requests to the backend services

### traefik (not part of this repo)

A configurable docker-compose example for a traefik setup can be found here:

## Q & A

### How to deploy on the cloud(aws etc)

The `docker-compose.yaml` file is for local deploy, if you want to deploy on the cloud,
you should prepare 2 Load Balancer(with HTTPS cert), one for websocket server, one for storage server.

The `VITE_APP_HTTP_STORAGE_BACKEND_URL` is for the Load Balancer URL(HTTPS) for storage,
and the `VITE_APP_WS_SERVER_URL` is for the Load Balancer URL(HTTPS) for websocket.

Here is a conversation about how to deploy on the aws: https://github.com/alswl/excalidraw-collaboration/issues/22

### generateKey problem

Error message:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'generateKey')
```

Why: The excalidraw is using crypto module of Javascript, the HTTPS is required.

How to solve: use HTTPS to access the page, or use http://localhost instead.
